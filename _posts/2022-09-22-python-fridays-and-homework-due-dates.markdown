After a bit of discussion with people in class yesterday and outside, I think
for the short-term future at least, we will do the following:

Fridays (for at least a while) will be mostly about working with Python and
Colab.  So if you already feel confident about these topics, you can safely
skip those classes.

In order to align that better with the homework due dates, the homework due
dates will shift later, to Mondays rather than Fridays.  I have updated the
schedule page with this revision, and the due dates set in Gradescope.

Mondays and Wednesdays will be more about concepts and less about programming
specifically, though I'll still generally use Python to demonstrate things.
