We are just about to the point where the "**methodology**" is due.

That might not be the best name for it.  But what I had in mind is a "check-in" with me about how the project is going.  By this point you should have located the data you plan to work on and have processed at least some of it, or have worked out how you'll be processing it.  Or at least there should be some substantial progress that you can tell me about.

What I'm looking for is something short.  Longer than just "everything's going great, on track to finishing" though -- specifically what has been done and what, based on that, do you feel is left?  What hasn't worked the way you'd hoped?  What's your plan for finishing this up by the end of the semester when the whole project is due?

It's informal, and graded basically on a "you turned it in" vs. "you didn't turn it in" scale, for the most part.  As long as there has been some substantial work and you tell me about it, that portion of the grade is secure.

I set the due date for this to be the class day before presentations start, so that you will have done this assessment in time to make use of it in your presentation.

The **presentation** is also nearing.  I don't have a lot to say about that except:

- It is important that it be no longer than the allotted time.  So, 10 minutes for undergraduates, 15 minutes for graduates.  Otherwise not everyone will fit in the time we have.
- The project does not need to be done, the conclusions do not need to be known.
- Describe what you're looking to discover or learn, and how you're going about it.
- If there are some results to show, you can show them.
- If there are some things you're getting stuck on, you can describe them.

In a way, this is kind of simulating presenting at a conference (although usually what you present at a conference is a bit more "done" than these might be).  Part of the challenge is figuring out how to say enough of what you want to say in the small number of minutes you have available.  But it's also kind of fun to see the projects.
