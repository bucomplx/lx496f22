The fourth homework (semantics) is now available.  Here is the link to the Colab notebook:

[HW4 Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MtRtwMa12RZRafU-9LJ-aJN1yx-h-C74?usp=sharing)

Or, you can [download the ipynb file directly]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/lx_96f22_hw04_semantics.ipynb)
or [as a zip file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/lx_96f22_hw04_semantics.ipynb.zip)

This one do NOT use the autograder on Gradescope, because I can't get it working properly.
