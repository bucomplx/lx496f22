The second homework (classification) is now available.  Here is the link to the Colab notebook:

[HW2 Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aS5f4JwXcljlowbx0yFgSySf37ClcH5G?usp=sharing)

Or, you can [download the ipynb file directly]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/lx_96f22_hw02_classification.ipynb)
or [as a zip file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/lx_96f22_hw02_classification.ipynb.zip)

This one uses the autograder on Gradescope,
though it's mostly just for you to be able to run checks locally as you work.
