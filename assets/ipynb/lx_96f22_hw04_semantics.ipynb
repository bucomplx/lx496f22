[SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU) is Terry Winograd's program from 1971 that could converse about things in its very limited universe of a block world.  You can find a video of it doing its thing [on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo4RvYJYOzI).  You can see it doing a lot of pretty interesting things.  Learning names for things, remembering what it was talking about, moving blocks around, making plans to accomplish goals.  Ours will not be that sophisticated.\n",

        "In service of this goal, we will need to accept input, parse the trees, and assign a semantics to the parsed sentences so that we can query or act on the blocks world. So there are a couple of pre-requisites.  In this first assignment (of two) we will work on doing the semantic parsing and world representation, and some of the display planning.  The second assignment will get deeper into making it actual work."
